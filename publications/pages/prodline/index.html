          I began at Mainstream Engineering as an intern with a very low bar of
          expected value output, as most interns do. However, it wasn’t long
          before I realized they had a problem: a brand new Rotomolding machine
          from Rotoline had just been purchased without an exact plan of
          execution. Seeing this, I took the initiative to design a preliminary
          production floor plan containing the machine as well as other relevant
          production factors. The first iteration of the plan is the first image
          below. As my second week began, I walked into the CFO’s office and
          invited him to my meeting regarding the implementation of the new
          Rotoline Machine. I originally thought it would be a quick meeting
          with him and the COO, but he then invited the CEO and a handful of
          other relevant corporate personnel that I didn’t even think to invite.
          So in my second week of employment as an intern, I found myself
          presenting a plan for a production line layout to a whole bunch of
          people far more qualified than me to be responsible for the project. I
          distinctly remember how nervous I was before that meeting, but once I
          got into my element, it felt natural. I defended my layout against
          others who, apparently, were planning to make a layout completely
          differently. It was a critical point in my life because it was the
          first time I have had the opportunity to argue with industry veterans
          and executives who disagreed with me about the best way to spend
          hundreds of thousands of dollars. From then on, I became the
          unofficial Project Manager for that new production line. I was soon
          faced with countless problems I had no experience solving before, but
          I’ve since realized those are really the best kind of problems because
          failure isn’t expected, it is imminent. When you know that failure, at
          least the first time is imminent, all of a sudden the fear of it
          vanishes and you are left with the uniquely energizing feeling of
          exploring the unknown for the first time. I love that feeling. Over
          the next few months, I redesigned the layout many times--even as we
          broke ground on a small construction project to expand that warehouse
          into a nearby one. This, of course, is because the machine itself
          didn’t actually fit inside the warehouse with the orientation I
          wanted--hence the point of contention during that very first meeting I
          mentioned--so an expansion project was necessary. I designed the small
          extension based on prior construction experience, but the challenge
          here was spanning the roof load across a 25 foot opening in the side
          of the warehouse to allow for the machine to pass inside of it, so I
          designed and performed analysis on a custom steel structure to support
          it. The next big problem to tackle was the overhead steel framework of
          I-beams that I painstakingly designed over and over again to find the
          perfect beam orientation that balanced material cost and feasibility
          of construction. I primarily used finite element analysis to analyze
          the framework with multiple load conditions. Seeing as there was
          pretty large liability risk if I undersized the beams, my work on this
          was checked and approved by an outside structural engineer. The
          purpose of the beams was to support hoppers full of plastic powder and
          hoists directly above each mold. The next phase of the project was
          making it all happen. We needed more manpower, so we hired an external
          crew to hang the beams while I oversaw and directed the process. Even
          with the expansion, the machine fit inside the building with a margin
          of error of a couple inches. This means that the steel framework also
          had to be placed in the correct position within an inch in either
          direction. I spent many sleepless nights second guessing every minute
          detail trying to spot an oversight before it turned into an expensive
          mistake. With the most stressful construction projects successfully
          complete, the next step was to build the machine that arrived in
          pieces in shipping containers; I learned that adults don’t get tired
          of legos, they just step up to much bigger and more expensive ones.
          Nothing in my life was more stressful than the day we finished
          building that machine and cycled the carts back and forth on their
          tracks to see if it collided with anything. No matter how many times I
          measured or how accurate the CAD was, that was a heart-pounding
          moment. Fortunately, everything worked out and the greatest
          responsibility of my life had been successfully handled. Now, during
          all that stress, I was also managing a few other projects such as the
          Mold Lift Machine and the Motorized Rollout Platform. I’ll leave those
          to their own pages.
