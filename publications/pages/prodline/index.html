          An automatic mold lift machine is designed to handle and transport
          heavy molds used in manufacturing, improving efficiency and reducing
          manual labor. It operates with precision controls to align and place
          molds into production machinery, such as injection molding or press
          machines, minimizing downtime. This machine is a crucial component in
          automated manufacturing lines, where mold changes are frequent and
