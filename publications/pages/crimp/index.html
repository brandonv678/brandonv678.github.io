          This problem was straightforward. Our operators were using large,
          unwieldy crimpers to crimp fairly large power cables for a unit we
          produced. These were so inconvenient that they usually required two
          people to use-- it was inefficient. At first, I looked into purchasing
          an automatic crimper for that size wire. The prices were absurdly
          expensive for an automatic air pressure crimper. Seeing this, I began
          designing my own method to crimp the cables. This is image 1, the
          first design. The first design looked cool and worked in theory, but
          after I ran the design and my force calculations by another engineer,
          he helped me realize that I could solve the problem more effectively
          with an entirely different design. So I scrapped that and went back to
          the drawing board with a fresh perspective. The next design I came up
          with was sleeker, cheaper, and much more effective at solving the
          crimp force problem with less input force. That design is image 2. The
          tricky part for me at first was calculating the crimp force at the
          jaws based on the output from the air pressure actuator. This is what
          I got wrong with the first design so I wanted to make sure I taught
          myself correctly, although I hadnâ€™t taken any engineering classes up
          to that point. The real challenge was ensuring that the crimps from my
          machine would pass the quality control inspection
          procedure--everything had to pass based on government-required
          standards. After triple-checking my calculations, I spent the one or
          two thousand dollars that this comparatively cheap project cost and
          sent the drawings over to our machine shop. The end product came
          together like a Lego set--it was particularly satisfying. I also
          3D-printed a mount for the final result, image 3, and a safety cover
          to prevent wandering fingers from accidentally getting crimped.
          Overall, this product was a great success. Not only were the operators
          thrilled by the trouble I saved them, but our throughput on these
          cables improved tremendously.
